We don't know exactly how this will turn out.  Just look at how unattractive this page looks lol -- clearly we're working on ourselves.

I'm still trying to figure out what I'll end up putting here.  I think I'm drawn to Shawn Wang's concept of \\\"Learning in Public.\\\"  Mostly because I've learned so much from other developers who have done the same.  In fact I'm still to this day shocked at how easy it is to find tutorials/blog posts/and real live help from people for free online.  I feel a bit indebted to the software dev community in that sense and would love to help anyone out who could somewhat benefit from me.  Learning in public is basically putting out in public what you're working on and learning even though you feel like you don't have a clue what you're doing.  In return you might be able to help someone out like how others have already helped you out, you'll track your progress, and you'll be more motivated to get things done.  Probably the most important is that you'll learn things better when you know you might have to teach it.  Plain and simple. To start off I want to say flat out that I know everything that you see here looks unpolished.  I don't know if that's a bad or a good thing.  I mean, I loved how amateurish and simple craigslist is.  I know even this blog needs to be styled better.

To top it all off, you can get prizes at the end of the year just like the comedians!  It is a social app so you can share with your friends who you liked and brag about who saw who first.  In the future, there is a lot of opportunity here for you to build up your profile to come up with better recommendation algorithms based on your sense of humor.  And of course, a lot of opportunity for more prizes!\\n\\n\"}),Object(s.jsx)(\"div\",{class:\"centertext\",children:\"Sponsors\"}),Object(s.jsx)(\"pre\",{children:\"\\n\\nWhen a company sponsors a competition, whether it be on the global or the local level they are getting seen by a demographic that loves to laugh and is willing to go out and spend money while doing so. \\n\\n\\nAnd lastly...\\n\\n\\n\"}),Object(s.jsx)(\"div\",{class:\"centertext\",children:\"Investors\"}),Object(s.jsx)(\"pre\",{children:\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are no investors so we don\\u2019t have to do anything to please them!  This is critical to the app.  I taught myself to code up this app and I continue to fund it myself.  I don\\u2019t have to be forced by an investor to monetize in some weird way.  I don\\u2019t have to create any profit at all for an investor.  To go even further, I don\\u2019t have a venue to pay or programmers to pay.  True I do want to pay myself, but I am gainfully employed and can run this at a loss for a while and having it replace my current job isn\\u2019t even necessary so running it at a small profit can be done for an even longer while if that is what is necessary to make this successful.  This means that more sponsorship money can drop down to comedians (and secondarily, fans).  Due to this unique setup I would put this company\\u2019s income statement against ANY comedy company in the world to see who gives the highest percentage of revenues to comedians.  This is a big point I want to get across.  \\n\\nIt is possible that costs may get out of control, in which case I may reach out to a VC, but I believe that won\\u2019t happen this year.  I already have existing relationships with people in the finance industry and will be keeping those lines of communication going in case they are needed.\\n\\nSo comedians and fans, we are in alignment here and I need you to use the app and keep giving me great feedback because that will bring sponsorship, comedian exposure, and ultimately make it fun for fans.  How big are the marketing budgets of big time comedy movies?  How big are the marketing budgets of alcohol companies?  The current prize pot we have is less than a drop in the bucket for them.  If we get one of those sponsorship deals, how much of that flows down to the comedian when I have no employees or investors to pay off?  The math adds up to a lot of money given away in a way that is completely new to the industry. \\n\\n\\nA lot more to come...\\n\\n\\nPete\\n\\nNext topic:  What are we going to do about the name?\\n\\n\"})]})})};var T=function(){return Object(s.jsx)(\"html\",{children:Object(s.jsxs)(\"body\",{children:[Object(s.jsx)(\"b\",{children:Object(s.jsx)(\"div\",{class:\"centertext\",children:\"What's in a name?\"})}),Object(s.jsx)(\"br\",{}),Object(s.jsx)(\"br\",{}),Object(s.jsx)(\"div\",{class:\"centertext\",children:\"6/15/23\"}),Object(s.jsx)(\"pre\",{children:\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\u2019s about that time where we address the name \\u201cPobblebonk\\u201d.  It\\u2019s goofy.  Intentionally.  It\\u2019s a comedy app afterall.  However, I do believe some people have suffered embarrassment trying to talk to people about it.  I\\u2019m sorry.  Perhaps we went too goofy and hard to say.  To be fair, there are people who have told me to keep the name.\\n\\nOn the flip side, it might be fortunate that we\\u2019ve had such a name while we\\u2019ve worked out the bugs.  The app has been available for just under a year and it\\u2019s gone through so many changes. It\\u2019s almost unrecognizable from the first iteration.  Now that we have a complete MVP (Minimum Viable Product), we have a chance to unveil it as something new and with a year\\u2019s worth of time underneath our belts to work out bugs.  Not to mention a year's worth of runway for me to learn to be a programmer/tech person (still learning!).  In a way, it was kind of the beta period.  In fact, if I were to do it all over again, I may have considered doing some sort of private beta.  But at the time I wasn't even really aware of that sort of thing, I was just excited to be doing something I've never done before and enjoyed showing it to people.  We are where we are.\\n\\nSo let\\u2019s vote on the name!  I'm more than happy to change it, however I will likely keep the frog as a mascot because my Dad drew the frog with the microphone so it holds some sentimental value.  Tomorrow I\\u2019m going to post a question on our instagram asking for suggestions.  I\\u2019m also going to reach out to previous winners to ask them personally.  I'm also going to ask Google Bard to come up with a name.  The voting will be done like a sport bracket.  Instagram allows us four options on a poll.  So I want people to have eight total options to vote on.  I\\u2019ll do two four name votes, then take the top two from each one and have everyone vote on the final four.  Then taking those votes I\\u2019ll choose from those top four.  I can\\u2019t guarantee that the highest voted one will be picked, but it will be taken into account.   \\n\\nAnd then we can move forward without hesitation on getting the word out.  I can\\u2019t promise everyone will be happy, but everyone will have a chance to have their voice heard.\\n\\n\\nThanks for following,\\n\\nPete\\n\\n\\nNext topic: dive into the scoring

I'm still trying to figure out what I'll end up putting here.  I think I'm drawn to Shawn Wang's concept of \\\"Learning in Public.\\\"  Mostly because I've learned so much from other developers who have done the same.  In fact I'm still to this day shocked at how easy it is to find tutorials/blog posts/and real live help from people for free online.  I feel a bit indebted to the software dev community in that sense and would love to help anyone out who could somewhat benefit from me.  Learning in public is basically putting out in public what you're working on and learning even though you feel like you don't have a clue what you're doing.  In return you might be able to help someone out like how others have already helped you out, you'll track your progress, and you'll be more motivated to get things done.  Probably the most important is that you'll learn things better when you know you might have to teach it.  Plain and simple. To start off I want to say flat out that I know everything that you see here looks unpolished.  I don't know if that's a bad or a good thing.  I mean, I loved how amateurish and simple craigslist is.  I know even this blog needs to be styled better.

This can be done on the global level, but also on the local level.  So for instance, if we get a decent amount of users in Austin, I can approach companies based in Austin to sponsor some prize money.  \\n\\nWhat is the cost to you?  Absolutely nothing!

It\\u2019s one in which you get to choose your favorite comedians and doing so gives them points.  In fact the way that comedians can get the most points is through fan interaction.  So whether you thought a comedian was hilarious or even if you just want to support your scene, you can make that happen.  It\\u2019s also set up so if the comedian bombs, no one knows on the app.  But if they kill, they get rewarded.  It encourages you to go see your local scene because that's where the next global star is made.  Imagine seeing the next Dave Chappelle at an open mic or showcase and being able to show that you saw them there in the app!  Or, if you like you can go see the actual Dave Chappelle and have that be recorded too.  The app makes it so that you can open up the app wherever you are in the world and find great comedy around you and get suggestions.  To top it all off, you can get prizes at the end of the year just like the comedians!  It is a social app so you can share with your friends who you liked and brag about who saw who first.  In the future, there is a lot of opportunity here for you to build up your profile to come up with better recommendation algorithms based on your sense of humor.

This is critical to the app.  I taught myself to code up this app and I continue to fund it myself.  I don\\u2019t have to be forced by an investor to monetize in some weird way.  I don\\u2019t have to create any profit at all for an investor.  To go even further, I don\\u2019t have a venue to pay or programmers to pay.  True I do want to pay myself, but I am gainfully employed and can run this at a loss for a while and having it replace my current job isn\\u2019t even necessary so running it at a small profit can be done for an even longer while if that is what is necessary to make this successful.  This means that more sponsorship money can drop down to comedians (and secondarily, fans).  Due to this unique setup I would put this company\\u2019s income statement against ANY comedy company in the world to see who gives the highest percentage of revenues to comedians.  This is a big point I want to get across.  \\n\\nIt is possible that costs may get out of control, in which case I may reach out to a VC, but I believe that won\\u2019t happen this year.  I already have existing relationships with people in the finance industry and will be keeping those lines of communication going in case they are needed.\\n\\nSo comedians and fans, we are in alignment here and I need you to use the app and keep giving me great feedback because that will bring sponsorship, comedian exposure, and ultimately make it fun for fans.  How big are the marketing budgets of big time comedy movies?  How big are the marketing budgets of alcohol companies?  The current prize pot we have is less than a drop in the bucket for them.  If we get one of those sponsorship deals, how much of that flows down to the comedian when I have no employees or investors to pay off?

Not to mention a year's worth of runway for me to learn to be a programmer/tech person (still learning!).  In a way, it was kind of the beta period.  In fact, if I were to do it all over again, I may have considered doing some sort of private beta.

It's an app made specifically for the local comedy community.  Secondly, please be patient as we are in our first year and trying to figure ourselves out.  I would describe us as a pilot program.  We don't know exactly how this will turn out.  Just look at how unattractive this page looks lol -- clearly we're working on ourselves.  Thirdly, an important cornerstone of this app is a points system.  For the most part users will get points by checking into mics.  What can you do with points?  We're still figuring this out but this is a rough framework:<ul>\n\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t    <br />\n\t\t\t    <li>The comedian with the most points every six months will get a free headshot/comedy cover photoshoot and will be posted on @pobblebonklive on IG.  We'll fly out to you.</li>\n\t\t\t    <li>The fan with the most points every six months will get a free ticket to a show in their area</li>\n\t\t\t    <li>Since we are based in Miami everything that we do will be first tried in Miami.  The Miami fan with the most points every three months in Miami will get a free ticket to a show in Miami</li>\n\n\t\t\t    <li>The first 100 of you who submit a verified mic that then has someone check into that is not you, you will be asked if you want access to the beta version of the Notes app and you can be a beta tester.  Eventually the Notes app will have at least two tiers of a premium version and all beta testers will get the first tier free.</li>\n\n\t\t\t    <li><b>Lastly, the biggest bonus of all: every three months for the next year at least, the comedian who submits the most mics will get an \"Everything\" account.  This means that everything that eventually comes to this app in the future will be free FOREVER. </b>  The mic that you submit does not have to be your own!  It just has to be verified with a flyer or a listing on another site.  I'm trying to avoid the situation where someone just submits their home address and just checks in each week to get their points up.</li>\n\t\t    </ul>\n\t\t\t<b>Currently Working on:</b>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Points system needs to be worked on.  It has to benefit people who go to a variety of mics.</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Getting it passable for iOS App Store, which we believe is more likely to deny the app.</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t<br />\n\n\t\n\n\t    \n\t\t\t<b> 1/1/22</b> - Happy New Year from Michigan!  I'm still trying to figure out what I'll end up putting here.  I think I'm drawn to Shawn Wang's concept of \"Learning in Public.\"  Mostly because I've learned so much from other developers who have done the same.  In fact I'm still to this day shocked at how easy it is to find tutorials/blog posts/and real live help from people for free online.  I feel a bit indebted to the software dev community in that sense and would love to help anyone out who could somewhat benefit from me.  Learning in public is basically putting out in public what you're working on and learning even though you feel like you don't have a clue what you're doing.  In return you might be able to help someone out like how others have already helped you out, you'll track your progress, and you'll be more motivated to get things done.  Probably the most important is that you'll learn things better when you know you might have to teach it.  Plain and simple.\n\t\t\tTo start off I want to say flat out that I know everything that you see here looks unpolished.  I don't know if that's a bad or a good thing.  I mean, I loved how amateurish and simple craigslist is.  I know even this blog needs to be styled better.  But this is what I hope is a multi-year project that I just chip away at in my free time and things should look like a more put together package as I get more time.</h3><h3> The app is fully functional as noted before and I was going to start giving it away today to a select few comedians but in waiting for the ball to drop last night I downloaded the latest version on my phone and and I want to work that out.  I plan on heading back to Miami towards the end of the month and will be more active in distributing the beta release by then.  I'll also be networking quite a bit in the #MiamiTech scene because I'm going to have to pivot my attention a little bit away from programming to the actual rolling out of the project and all the issues involved with that.  I don't come from the tech world so I feel like I'm in my freshman year of college on this stuff.  So far I've just been watching Silicon Valley on HBO Max!\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Currently Working On</b>:  <ul><li>App: page doesn't refresh after transitioning to a separate page</li><li>Website: Making a new hamburger menu for website that uses React and grid</li><li>Website: create a real blog page that draws from a database</li> </ul>\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t<b>12/26/21</b> - The app is fully functional.

When you travel to a different city you'll be able to help determine that city's top comic and help them get onto the global leaderboard.  Fans can follow comedians and be notified immediately when a new mic or showcase is announced by that comedian.  You can also list what comedian you want to see come to your city.  In the future, if there are a lot of people that want to see a comedian, we can let that comedian know! <br/><br/> \n\nWhen comedians interact with the app, they are getting their name out there to the most hardcore stand up comedy fans.

Comics can win cash prizes and credits while Fans can win tickets!  World's Top Comic will win $500 and Top Fan will win a pair of tickets to a show of their choosing!

Let's say she has a work trip in Denver.  She does all of her meetings and she has a flight the next day and doesn't know what to do the night before.  She can open the app and discover the local stand up scene.  She can see who is getting favorited from the community and see where they are performing.  Maybe she’ll see someone who will become a big star one day.  Maybe not.  Either way it’ll be in her profile and she will have supported the art form. <br/><br/>\n\nFor comedians, ideally there are people like the woman above in the audience, when under normal circumstances, she wouldn't have been there.  We are trying to give people that extra push to go see live stand up comedy and in turn get people in seats.  We are not trying to take market share, we are trying to make the market bigger.

You can build up your history in the app.  I always thought it would be cool if the app were available years ago and you’d be able to look in your app and say “I saw Dave Chappelle at some divey open mic in Brooklyn and he wasn’t even that good yet!  I favorited some other comedian.”  You may see going to open mics/showcases as “collecting comedians” in your profile.   \n\t\t  </details>\n\n\t\t\t  <br />\n\t\t  \t\t  \t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>Why would I list myself as a host?</summary>\n\t\t\t When you are a host of a mic, you will receive an extra point for checking into the mic you are hosting.  You will also be eligible to win Top Mic/Host awards.  The app provides host features where you can see in real-time who has checked in.  Some people have mentioned that they can work with the bar to give drinks to the first people who check in.  Others have mentioned that they want to use it as the open mic sign up list.

With potential for more if they favorite you!     \n\t\t  </details> <br />\n <details>\n\t\t      <summary>Can I get validated at an open mic that only has comedians?</summary>\n\t\t\t    Yes, you can get validated by other comedians, you just won't receive the same amount of points per validation as you would from fans.\n </details><br />\n <details>\n\t\t      <summary>Well couldn't someone just get their friends to follow them all over the place to get points?</summary>\n\t\t\tYes, but in addition, the variety of people that validate you will figure into your score as well.  Over a contest that spans a whole year, winning by just bringing your friends around would be really hard and you might lose friends.   \n\t\t  </details>\n\t\t\t  <br/>\n\t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>Can't someone like Jo Koy tell one of their stadium audiences to download the app and favorite them and win the contest?</summary>\n\t\t\t    No, there is a requirement that in order to be eligible the user has to check into at least 4 open mics and be validated at one.\t  Winner must also have less than 1.25M followers on Instagram.  We’re not trying to find Dave Chappelle or Jo Koy, the world has already found them.  \n\t\t  </details>\n\t\t\t  <br/>\n\n\t\t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>How will you monetize?</summary>\n\t\t\t We're not sure yet, but the first thing we're going to try is find a sponsor if we get enough people using the app.  Ideally there is no cost to comedians, ever.  The Miami Open just happened here in Miami and they have banks, watch makers, and other sponsors.  Why wouldn't a media brand want to sponsor the only global competition for the next hot comic that is largely determined by the fans?  Or an upcoming comedy movie that wants to get the word out to comedy fans?  We need to grow in numbers, but If you are interested in sponsoring or know someone or some company who might…let’s talk and come up with something that makes sense. \n\t\t  </details>\n\t\t\t  <br />\n\n\t\t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>How long will this last?</summary>\n\t\t\tOne of the reasons I committed myself to this app is because I thought I could pull off teaching myself to code and therefore save the company tens to even hundreds of thousands of dollars in cost compared to hiring a developer.  Turns out that with some hard work and time I was able to pull that off somehow.  This brings our cost structure down and the biggest recurring expense on this venture right now is cash and non cash prizes that go straight to comedians.  I hope to continue in that spirit.  If we are unable to achieve the numbers this year to get a sponsor, there are ways to reduce costs until we pivot as we find the right product market fit.  We can even downsize prizes.  In other words, this can go on for a very long time even if we are unsuccessful in achieving a sponsor. I do view it as a legacy project that will run even after I'm gone.  If we get sponsors then EVERYTHING gets better.  We can make better prizes and try new things.

In that short time frame of 2022 alone we had 300+ check-ins and created what we believe is the biggest and most accurate open mic list in the world.  Winners of last year’s contest already received cash prizes and we are still working on merch for them!

This is a big relief and will allow us to now pivot to working on the fan experience and also reaching out to them and seeing what they like.   \n\t\t  </details>\n\n\t\t\t  <br />\n\n\n\t\t  \t\t  \t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>What's coming in the future?</summary>\n\t\t\tA lot depends on how quickly things progress, but a lot of cool things we can do like booking options, badges, improved recommendation algorithms, and definitely merch! \n\t\t  </details>\n\n\t\t\t  <br />\n\n\t\t\t  <p>Thank you everyone for following along and reading this, please provide feedback if you have it.

The app has gone through a lot of revisions – I’ve submitted over 200 builds to the app stores since this all started less than a year ago!  I think it’s important to look at the value proposition from the standpoint of comedians, fans, sponsors, and investors. `}\n\n\t\t\t  </pre>\n\n\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"centertext\">Comedians</div>\n\n  <pre>\n\n\t  {`\nI want comedians to use this app to both make money and gain exposure.  There are plenty of ways to gain exposure, so I want to highlight that making some money on the app is front and center.  The monetization strategy of this app is through sponsorship.  That means the more we use this app, the bigger the sponsorship deals I can get and the more that can flow down to comedians’ hands.  This can be done on the global level, but also on the local level.  So for instance, if we get a decent amount of users in Austin, I can approach companies based in Austin to sponsor some prize money.  \n\nWhat is the cost to you?  Absolutely nothing!  You don’t have to pay to be considered, like at a comedy festival.  You just have to do what you were going to do anyway and just click a button to check in and watch your points go up.\n\n`}\n\n  </pre>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"centertext\">Fans</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  <pre>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  {`\n\nI’ve built the app so fans have a new way to experience live stand up comedy.  It’s one in which you get to choose your favorite comedians and doing so gives them points.  In fact the way that comedians can get the most points is through fan interaction.  So whether you thought a comedian was hilarious or even if you just want to support your scene, you can make that happen.  It’s also set up so if the comedian bombs, no one knows on the app.  But if they kill, they get rewarded.  It encourages you to go see your local scene because that's where the next global star is made.  Imagine seeing the next Dave Chappelle at an open mic or showcase and being able to show that you saw them there in the app!  Or, if you like you can go see the actual Dave Chappelle and have that be recorded too.  The app makes it so that you can open up the app wherever you are in the world and find great comedy around you and get suggestions.  To top it all off, you can get prizes at the end of the year just like the comedians!  It is a social app so you can share with your friends who you liked and brag about who saw who first.  In the future, there is a lot of opportunity here for you to build up your profile to come up with better recommendation algorithms based on your sense of humor.  And of course, a lot of opportunity for more prizes!\n\n`}\n\n\t\t\t\t  </pre>\n\n\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"centertext\">Sponsors</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t  <pre>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  {`\n\nWhen a company sponsors a competition, whether it be on the global or the local level they are getting seen by a demographic that loves to laugh and is willing to go out and spend money while doing so. \n\n\nAnd lastly...\n\n\n`}\n\t\t\t\t  </pre>\n\n\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"centertext\">Investors</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  <pre>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  {`\n\nCurrently, there are no investors so we don’t have to do anything to please them!  This is critical to the app.  I taught myself to code up this app and I continue to fund it myself.  I don’t have to be forced by an investor to monetize in some weird way.  I don’t have to create any profit at all for an investor.  To go even further, I don’t have a venue to pay or programmers to pay.  True I do want to pay myself, but I am gainfully employed and can run this at a loss for a while and having it replace my current job isn’t even necessary so running it at a small profit can be done for an even longer while if that is what is necessary to make this successful.  This means that more sponsorship money can drop down to comedians (and secondarily, fans).  Due to this unique setup I would put this company’s income statement against ANY comedy company in the world to see who gives the highest percentage of revenues to comedians.  This is a big point I want to get across.  \n\nIt is possible that costs may get out of control, in which case I may reach out to a VC, but I believe that won’t happen this year.  I already have existing relationships with people in the finance industry and will be keeping those lines of communication going in case they are needed.\n\nSo comedians and fans, we are in alignment here and I need you to use the app and keep giving me great feedback because that will bring sponsorship, comedian exposure, and ultimately make it fun for fans.  How big are the marketing budgets of big time comedy movies?  How big are the marketing budgets of alcohol companies?  The current prize pot we have is less than a drop in the bucket for them.  If we get one of those sponsorship deals, how much of that flows down to the comedian when I have no employees or investors to pay off?  The math adds up to a lot of money given away in a way that is completely new to the industry. \n\n\nA lot more to come...\n\n\nPete\n\nNext topic:  What are we going to do about the name?\n\n`}\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  </pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t  </body>\n\n\t  </html>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nexport default Boardroom;\n","import '../App2.css';\n\n\n\nfunction Name() {\n\n\n\n\n  return (\n\t  <html>\n\n\n\t\t  <body>\n\n\n\t\t\t  <b><div class=\"centertext\">What's in a name?</div></b><br/><br/>\n\n\t\t\t  <div class=\"centertext\">6/15/23</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t  <pre>\n\n\t\t\t\t  {`\n\n\n\nIt’s about that time where we address the name “Pobblebonk”.  It’s goofy.  Intentionally.  It’s a comedy app afterall.  However, I do believe some people have suffered embarrassment trying to talk to people about it.  I’m sorry.  Perhaps we went too goofy and hard to say.  To be fair, there are people who have told me to keep the name.\n\nOn the flip side, it might be fortunate that we’ve had such a name while we’ve worked out the bugs.  The app has been available for just under a year and it’s gone through so many changes. It’s almost unrecognizable from the first iteration.  Now that we have a complete MVP (Minimum Viable Product), we have a chance to unveil it as something new and with a year’s worth of time underneath our belts to work out bugs.  Not to mention a year's worth of runway for me to learn to be a programmer/tech person (still learning!).  In a way, it was kind of the beta period.  In fact, if I were to do it all over again, I may have considered doing some sort of private beta.  But at the time I wasn't even really aware of that sort of thing, I was just excited to be doing something I've never done before and enjoyed showing it to people.  We are where we are.\n\nSo let’s vote on the name!  I'm more than happy to change it, however I will likely keep the frog as a mascot because my Dad drew the frog with the microphone so it holds some sentimental value.  Tomorrow I’m going to post a question on our instagram asking for suggestions.  I’m also going to reach out to previous winners to ask them personally.  I'm also going to ask Google Bard to come up with a name.  The voting will be done like a sport bracket.  Instagram allows us four options on a poll.  So I want people to have eight total options to vote on.  I’ll do two four name votes, then take the top two from each one and have everyone vote on the final four.  Then taking those votes I’ll choose from those top four.  I can’t guarantee that the highest voted one will be picked, but it will be taken into account.   \n\nAnd then we can move forward without hesitation on getting the word out.  I can’t promise everyone will be happy, but everyone will have a chance to have their voice heard.\n\n\nThanks for following,\n\nPete\n\n\nNext topic: dive into the scoring system!\n\n`}\n\n\n\n\t\t\t  </pre>\n\n\n\t\t  </body>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t  </html>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nexport default Name;\n","//import {useState} from 'react';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport Home from './pages/Home'\nimport Blog from './pages/Blog'\nimport Contact from './pages/Contact'\nimport About from './pages/About'\nimport Legal from './pages/Legal'\nimport Tos from './pages/Tos'\nimport Pp from './pages/Pp'\nimport Promotion22 from './pages/Promotion22'\nimport Promotion23 from './pages/Promotion23'\nimport HOF from './pages/HOF'\nimport FAQ from './pages/FAQ'\nimport Boardroom from './pages/Boardroom'\nimport Name from './pages/Name'\n\nfunction App() {\n\n\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n\t  <Routes>\n\t\t  <Route path=\"/blog\" element={<Blog/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/\" element={<Home/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/Contact\" element={<Contact/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/About\" element={<About/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/Legal\" element={<Legal/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/Tos\" element={<Tos/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/Pp\" element={<Pp/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/Promotion22\" element={<Promotion22/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/HOF\" element={<HOF/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/FAQ\" element={<FAQ/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/Promotion23\" element={<Promotion23/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/Boardroom\" element={<Boardroom/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/Name\" element= {<Name/>} />\n\n\t\t  \n\t</Routes>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n//import './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\nimport { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <BrowserRouter>\n    <App/>\n  </BrowserRouter>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
