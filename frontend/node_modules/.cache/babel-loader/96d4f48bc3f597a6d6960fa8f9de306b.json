It\\u2019s goofy.  Intentionally.  It\\u2019s a comedy app afterall.  However, I do believe some people have suffered embarrassment trying to talk to people about it.  I\\u2019m sorry.  Perhaps we went too goofy and hard to say.  To be fair, there are people who have told me to keep the name.\\n\\nOn the flip side, it might be fortunate that we\\u2019ve had such a name while we\\u2019ve worked out the bugs.

Now that we have a complete MVP (Minimum Viable Product), we have a chance to unveil it as something new and with a year\\u2019s worth of time underneath our belts to work out bugs.  Not to mention give me some runway to kind of learn to be a programmer/tech person (still learning!).  In a way, it was kind of the beta period.

Tomorrow I\\u2019m going to post a question on our instagram asking for suggestions.  I\\u2019m also going to reach out to previous winners to ask them personally.  The voting will be done like a sport bracket.  You are allowed four options on an instagram poll.  So I want people to have eight total options to vote on.  I\\u2019ll do two four name votes, then take the top two from each one and have everyone vote on the final four.  Then taking those votes I\\u2019ll choose from those top four.  I can\\u2019t guarantee that the highest voted one will be picked, but it will be taken into account.   \\n\\nAnd then we can move forward without hesitation on getting the word out.
