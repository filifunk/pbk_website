It\\u2019s about that time where we address the name \\u201CPobblebonk\\u201D.  It\\u2019s goofy.  Intentionally.  It\\u2019s a comedy app afterall.

Tomorrow I\\u2019m going to post a question on our instagram asking for suggestions.  I\\u2019m also going to reach out to previous winners to ask them personally.  The voting will be done like a sport bracket.  You are allowed four options on an instagram poll.  So I want people to have eight total options to vote on.  I\\u2019ll do two four name votes, then take the top two from each one and have everyone vote on the final four.  Then taking those votes I\\u2019ll choose from those top four.  I can\\u2019t guarantee that the highest voted one will be picked, but it will be taken into account. And then we can move forward without hesitation on getting the word out.  I can\\u2019t promise everyone will be happy, but everyone will have a chance to have their voice heard.
