So whether you thought a comedian was hilarious or even if you just want to support your scene, you can make that happen.  It\\u2019s also set up so if the comedian bombs, no one knows on the app.  But if they kill, they get rewarded.  It encourages you to go see your local scene because that's where the next global star is made.  Imagine seeing the next Dave Chappelle at an open mic or showcase and being able to show that you saw them there in the app!  Or, if you like you can go see the actual Dave Chappelle and have that be recorded too.  The app makes it so that you can open up the app wherever you are in the world and find great comedy around you and get suggestions.  To top it all off, you can get prizes at the end of the year just like the comedians!  It is a social app so you can share with your friends who you liked and brag about who saw who first.
