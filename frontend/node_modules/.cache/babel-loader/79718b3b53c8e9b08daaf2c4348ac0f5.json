It’s goofy.  Intentionally.  It’s a comedy app afterall.  However, I do believe some people have suffered embarrassment trying to talk to people about it.  I’m sorry.  Perhaps we went too goofy and hard to say.  To be fair, there are people who have told me to keep the name.\n\nOn the flip side, it might be fortunate that we’ve had such a name while we’ve worked out the bugs.  The app has been available for just under a year and it’s gone through so many changes. It’s almost unrecognizable from the first iteration.  Now that we have a complete MVP (Minimum Viable Product), we have a chance to unveil it as something new and with a year’s worth of time underneath our belts to work out bugs.  Not to mention a year's worth of runway for me to learn to be a programmer/tech person (still learning!).  In a way, it was kind of the beta period.  In fact, if I were to do it all over again, I may have considered doing some sort of private beta.  But at the time I wasn't even really aware of that sort of thing, I was just excited to be doing something I've never done before and enjoyed showing it to people.  We are where we are.\n\nSo let’s vote on the name!  Tomorrow I’m going to post a question on our instagram asking for suggestions.  I’m also going to reach out to previous winners to ask them personally.  The voting will be done like a sport bracket.  Instagram allows us four options on a poll.  So I want people to have eight total options to vote on.  I’ll do two four name votes, then take the top two from each one and have everyone vote on the final four.  Then taking those votes I’ll choose from those top four.  I can’t guarantee that the highest voted one will be picked, but it will be taken into account.   \n\nAnd then we can move forward without hesitation on getting the word out.  I can’t promise everyone will be happy, but everyone will have a chance to have their voice heard.\n\n\nThanks for following,\n\nPete\n\n`\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 22,\n        columnNumber: 6\n      }, this)]\n    }, void 0, true, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 14,\n      columnNumber: 5\n    }, this)\n  }, void 0, false, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 11,\n    columnNumber: 4\n  }, this);\n}\n\n_c = Name;\nexport default Name;\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"Name\");","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/home/petemon/pobblebonk/frontend/src/pages/Name.js"],"names":["Name"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAO,aAAP;;;AAIA,SAASA,IAAT,GAAgB;AAKd,sBACC;AAAA,2BAGC;AAAA,8BAGC;AAAA,+BAAG;AAAK,UAAA,KAAK,EAAC,YAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAH;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAHD,eAGuD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAHvD,eAG4D;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAH5D,eAKC;AAAK,QAAA,KAAK,EAAC,YAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cALD,eAQC;AAAA,kBAEG;AACR;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAnBK;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cARD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAHD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,UADD;AAqDD;;KA1DQA,I;AA8DT,eAAeA,IAAf","sourcesContent":["import '../App2.css';\n\n\n\nfunction Name() {\n\n\n\n\n  return (\n\t  <html>\n\n\n\t\t  <body>\n\n\n\t\t\t  <b><div class=\"centertext\">What's in a name?</div></b><br/><br/>\n\n\t\t\t  <div class=\"centertext\">6/15/23</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t  <pre>\n\n\t\t\t\t  {`\n\n\n\nIt’s about that time where we address the name “Pobblebonk”.
