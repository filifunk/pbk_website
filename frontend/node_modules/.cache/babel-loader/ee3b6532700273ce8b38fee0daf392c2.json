Next year as we have more features and more users I would expect it will be much easier.    \\n\\nThis is the only city that I'm trying this on.  By the time December rolls around I will announce one other city for '24 if it picks up elsewhere.  By mid-year '24 I may announce more as higher levels of confidence are achieved.  The amount of cities is basically unlimited and it could be anywhere in the world (part of me thinks there's some interest in Australia) I just don't want to waste my time on a city that isn't engaging.  It is based on check-ins, the user base, and honestly whether I feel good about the leaders there and even interactions with some of the comics I talk to on instagram or in person.  It has to go where it seems welcome.  But it's mostly check-ins.  It may be that this hyperfocuses the app to Brooklyn for 2023, but it won't entirely.\\n\\nCan this all end?  Yes, if it doesn't grow.  Then this just goes into the graveyard of apps and websites that have tried to make something work in stand up comedy (I can name 4 off the top of my head).  The titles and cash can all be stripped away and should under the right circumstances.  But no plan B's until 2025 at the earliest.
