When you go and check into a show, you can \"favorite\" your top two comics that night.  You can follow your friends and see who they've seen and voted for lately.  When you travel to a different city you'll be able to help determine that city's top comic and help them get onto the global leaderboard.  Fans can follow comedians and be notified immediately when a new mic or showcase is announced by that comedian.  You can also list what comedian you want to see come to your city.  In the future, if there are a lot of people that want to see a comedian, we can let that comedian know! <br/><br/> \n\nWhen comedians interact with the app, they are getting their name out there to the most hardcore stand up comedy fans.  They may even get a tip from the audience because the app encourages it and also displays comedians' cash app/venmo .  Comedians can follow other comedians and be notified right away if a new mic is announced.\n\t\t\t    \n\t\t  </details>\t  \n\t\t\t  <br />\n\t\t  <details>\n\t\t      <summary>How do End Of Year Awards work?</summary>\n\t\t\t  The End Of Year Awards are won through competition.  We want comedians to use the competition as a credit generating machine to help further their careers. <br /><br /> \n\n\t\t\t  World's Top Comic, Top Comic (local), Hardest Working Comic, World's Top Mic/Host, Top Mic/Host (local), and Top Stand Up Comedy Scene.  The official rules are here, but basically checking into mics/showcases, submitting mics/showcases, and being funny and favorited by audience members will all help comedians and fans win prizes.  Comics can win cash prizes and credits while Fans can win tickets!  World's Top Comic will win $500 and Top Fan will win a pair of tickets to a show of their choosing!  See official rules for scoring rubric and prizes.  \n\t\t  </details>\t  \n\t\t    <br />\n\t\t  <details>\n\t\t      <summary>What is the ideal use case for the app?</summary>\n\t\t\t  I was talking to someone who said that she travels all over the place and loves stand up comedy but has no idea where to go other than the big shows.  Let's say she has a work trip in Denver.  She does all of her meetings and she has a flight the next day and doesn't know what to do the night before.  She can open the app and discover the local stand up scene.  She can see who is getting favorited from the community and see where they are performing.  Maybe she’ll see someone who will become a big star one day.  Maybe not.  Either way it’ll be in her profile and she will have supported the art form. <br/><br/>\n\nFor comedians, ideally there are people like the woman above in the audience, when under normal circumstances, she wouldn't have been there.  We are trying to give people that extra push to go see live stand up comedy and in turn get people in seats.  We are not trying to take market share, we are trying to make the market bigger.  Our success = your success. \n\t\t\t    \n\t\t  </details>\t  \n\t\t\t  <br/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t  <details>\n\t\t      <summary>What's with the open mic list?</summary>\n\t\t\t When I was traveling a lot I sometimes had a hard time finding open mics to perform at.

You can build up your history in the app.  I always thought it would be cool if the app were available years ago and you’d be able to look in your app and say “I saw Dave Chappelle at some divey open mic in Brooklyn and he wasn’t even that good yet!  I favorited some other comedian.”  You may see going to open mics/showcases as “collecting comedians” in your profile.   \n\t\t  </details>\n\n\t\t\t  <br />\n\t\t  \t\t  \t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>Why would I list myself as a host?</summary>\n\t\t\t When you are a host of a mic, you will receive an extra point for checking into the mic you are hosting.  You will also be eligible to win Top Mic/Host awards.  The app provides host features where you can see in real-time who has checked in.  Some people have mentioned that they can work with the bar to give drinks to the first people who check in.  Others have mentioned that they want to use it as the open mic sign up list.  If you are a host and want something in there, just send me a message.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   </details>\n\n\t\t\t  <br />\n\t\t\t  <details>  \n\t\t      <summary>Still having a hard time understanding what the app does?</summary>\n\t\t\tImagine it as the Untappd app, but for stand up comedy.  People use the Untappd app to discover new beers and show off what beers they are trying.  People will use Pobblebonk to discover new comedians and show off what comedians they've seen and who they liked the most.      \n\t\t  </details>\t<br />  <details>\n\t\t      <summary>What's the best way to get points as a comedian?</summary>\n\t\t\t Tell the audience to download the app and check in.  You can even put it on the flyer.  We will provide a QR code.  You can create a referral code to give to people.  Points given by fans are heavily weighted in the calculation of points.  If you get five fans to verify one performance, that’s 15 points!  With potential for more if they favorite you!     \n\t\t  </details> <br />\n <details>\n\t\t      <summary>Can I get validated at an open mic that only has comedians?</summary>\n\t\t\t    Yes, you can get validated by other comedians, you just won't receive the same amount of points per validation as you would from fans.\n </details><br />\n <details>\n\t\t      <summary>Well couldn't someone just get their friends to follow them all over the place to get points?</summary>\n\t\t\tYes, but in addition, the variety of people that validate you will figure into your score as well.  Over a contest that spans a whole year, winning by just bringing your friends around would be really hard and you might lose friends.   \n\t\t  </details>\n\t\t\t  <br/>\n\t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>Can't someone like Jo Koy tell one of their stadium audiences to download the app and favorite them and win the contest?</summary>\n\t\t\t    No, there is a requirement that in order to be eligible the user has to check into at least 4 open mics and be validated at one.\t  Winner must also have less than 1.25M followers on Instagram.  We’re not trying to find Dave Chappelle or Jo Koy, the world has already found them.  \n\t\t  </details>\n\t\t\t  <br/>\n\n\t\t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>How will you monetize?</summary>\n\t\t\t We're not sure yet, but the first thing we're going to try is find a sponsor if we get enough people using the app.  Ideally there is no cost to comedians, ever.  The Miami Open just happened here in Miami and they have banks, watch makers, and other sponsors.  Why wouldn't a media brand want to sponsor the only global competition for the next hot comic that is largely determined by the fans?  Or an upcoming comedy movie that wants to get the word out to comedy fans?  We need to grow in numbers, but If you are interested in sponsoring or know someone or some company who might…let’s talk and come up with something that makes sense. \n\t\t  </details>\n\t\t\t  <br />\n\n\t\t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>How long will this last?</summary>\n\t\t\tOne of the reasons I committed myself to this app is because I thought I could pull off teaching myself to code and therefore save the company tens to even hundreds of thousands of dollars in cost compared to hiring a developer.  Turns out that with some hard work and time I was able to pull that off somehow.  This brings our cost structure down and the biggest recurring expense on this venture right now is cash and non cash prizes that go straight to comedians.  I hope to continue in that spirit.  If we are unable to achieve the numbers this year to get a sponsor, there are ways to reduce costs until we pivot as we find the right product market fit.  We can even downsize prizes.  In other words, this can go on for a very long time even if we are unsuccessful in achieving a sponsor. I do view it as a legacy project that will run even after I'm gone.  If we get sponsors then EVERYTHING gets better.  We can make better prizes and try new things.
