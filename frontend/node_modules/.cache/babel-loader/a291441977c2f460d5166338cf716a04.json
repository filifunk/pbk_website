In addition, we retain personal information to comply with applicable law where required, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our Terms of Service, and other actions permitted by law. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.<br/><br/>\n\n\nIn some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.<br/><br/>\n\n\nWe employ industry standard security measures designed to protect the security of all information submitted through the Services. However, the security of information transmitted through the Internet can never be guaranteed. We are not responsible for any interception or interruption of any communications through the Internet or for changes to or losses of data. Users of the Services are responsible for maintaining the security of any password, biometrics, user ID or other form of authentication involved in obtaining access to password protected or secure areas of any of our digital services. In order to protect you and your data, we may suspend your use of any of the Services, without notice, pending an investigation, if any breach of security is suspected.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\t\t    <h2><u>Your Rights</u></h2><br/><br/>\n\n\nYou have the following rights with respect to your personal information and other aspects of the Services:<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n    • You have the right to ask us for an overview of your personal information that we process;<br/>\n\n    • You have the right to ask us to transfer your personal information directly to you or to another entity. This applies to personal information that we process by automated means and with your consent or on the basis of a contract with you. We will transfer your personal information where it is technically feasible;<br/>\n\n    • You may ask us to delete your personal information if we no longer need it for its original purpose, if you object to us processing your personal information for our own legitimate interests or for personalized commercial messages, if you withdraw your consent for processing your personal information, if we unlawfully process your personal information, or if a law requires us to erase your personal information;<br/>\n\n    • You can object to us using your personal information for our own legitimate interests. We will consider your objection and whether processing your personal information has any undue impact on you that requires us to stop doing so. You cannot object to us processing your personal information if we are legally required to do so (for example if we are obliged to fulfill a contract with you);<br/>\n\n    • We sometimes use systems to make automated decisions based on your personal information if this is necessary to fulfill a contract with you or if you gave us consent to do so. You have the right to object to such automated decisions and ask for an actual person to make the decision instead;<br/>\n\n    • If your personal information is incorrect, you have the right to ask us to rectify it. If we shared such data about you with a third party in compliance with this Policy, it is our obligation to notify this change to the third party;<br/>\n\n    • You have the right to ask us to restrict using your personal information if in your opinion the information is inaccurate, if we are processing the data unlawfully, or if you have objected to us processing your personal information for our own legitimate interests; and<br/>\n\n    • Should you not be satisfied with the way we have responded to your concerns, you have the right to submit a complaint to us using the contact information further up in this Policy. If you are still unhappy with our reaction to your complaint, you can also contact the data protection authority in your country.<br/>\n\n    • You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. You can choose whether or not to allow the Service to collect information through other tracking technologies. If you disable or refuse cookies or block the use of other tracking technologies, some parts of the Service may then be inaccessible or not function properly.<br/>\n\n    • You can choose to disallow the Service to collect and use real-time information about your device's location by emailing a request to privacy@pobblebonklive.com. If you block the use of location information, some parts of the Service may become inaccessible or not function properly.<br/>\n\n    • If you do not want us to use your contact information to promote our own or third parties' products or services, you can opt-out by sending us an email stating your request to privacy@pobblebonklive.com.<br/>\n\n    • If you do not want us to use information that we collect or that you provide to us to deliver advertisements according to our advertisers' target-audience preferences, you can opt-out by sending us an email stating your request to privacy@pobblebonklive.com.<br/>\n\n    • If you do not want us to share your personal information with unaffiliated or non-agent third parties for advertising and marketing purposes, you can opt-out by sending us an email stating your request to privacy@pobblebonklive.com.<br/>\n\n    • We do not control third parties' collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. You can opt out of receiving targeted ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\") on the NAI's website.<br/>\n\nPlease note that deletion of your personal information may make it impossible for you to use the websites or the Services.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\t\t    <h3><u>Do No Track </u></h3><br/><br/>\n\n\n“Do Not Track” is a privacy preference you can set in most web browsers. When you turn on this preference, it sends a signal or message to the websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Please note that we currently do not respond to Do Not Track browser settings.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\t\t    <h2><u>Third Party Payment Service</u></h2><br/><br/>\n\n\nThe Services may provide functionality allowing you to make payments using third-party payment services. When you use such a service to make a payment to us, your personal information will be collected by such third party and not by us and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\t\t    <h2><u>Minors</u></h2><br/><br/>\n\n\nWe do not intentionally gather personal information from visitors who are under the age of 18. Our Terms of Service require all users to be over the age of 18.
