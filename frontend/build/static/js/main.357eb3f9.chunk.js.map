It's an app made specifically for the local comedy community.  Secondly, please be patient as we are in our first year and trying to figure ourselves out.  I would describe us as a pilot program.  We don't know exactly how this will turn out.  Just look at how unattractive this page looks lol -- clearly we're working on ourselves.  Thirdly, an important cornerstone of this app is a points system.  For the most part users will get points by checking into mics.  What can you do with points?  We're still figuring this out but this is a rough framework:<ul>\n\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t    <br />\n\t\t\t    <li>The comedian with the most points every six months will get a free headshot/comedy cover photoshoot and will be posted on @pobblebonklive on IG.  We'll fly out to you.</li>\n\t\t\t    <li>The fan with the most points every six months will get a free ticket to a show in their area</li>\n\t\t\t    <li>Since we are based in Miami everything that we do will be first tried in Miami.  The Miami fan with the most points every three months in Miami will get a free ticket to a show in Miami</li>\n\n\t\t\t    <li>The first 100 of you who submit a verified mic that then has someone check into that is not you, you will be asked if you want access to the beta version of the Notes app and you can be a beta tester.  Eventually the Notes app will have at least two tiers of a premium version and all beta testers will get the first tier free.</li>\n\n\t\t\t    <li><b>Lastly, the biggest bonus of all: every three months for the next year at least, the comedian who submits the most mics will get an \"Everything\" account.  This means that everything that eventually comes to this app in the future will be free FOREVER. </b>  The mic that you submit does not have to be your own!  It just has to be verified with a flyer or a listing on another site.  I'm trying to avoid the situation where someone just submits their home address and just checks in each week to get their points up.</li>\n\t\t    </ul>\n\t\t\t<b>Currently Working on:</b>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Points system needs to be worked on.  It has to benefit people who go to a variety of mics.</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Getting it passable for iOS App Store, which we believe is more likely to deny the app.</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t<br />\n\n\t\n\n\t    \n\t\t\t<b> 1/1/22</b> - Happy New Year from Michigan!  I'm still trying to figure out what I'll end up putting here.  I think I'm drawn to Shawn Wang's concept of \"Learning in Public.\"  Mostly because I've learned so much from other developers who have done the same.  In fact I'm still to this day shocked at how easy it is to find tutorials/blog posts/and real live help from people for free online.  I feel a bit indebted to the software dev community in that sense and would love to help anyone out who could somewhat benefit from me.  Learning in public is basically putting out in public what you're working on and learning even though you feel like you don't have a clue what you're doing.  In return you might be able to help someone out like how others have already helped you out, you'll track your progress, and you'll be more motivated to get things done.  Probably the most important is that you'll learn things better when you know you might have to teach it.  Plain and simple.\n\t\t\tTo start off I want to say flat out that I know everything that you see here looks unpolished.  I don't know if that's a bad or a good thing.  I mean, I loved how amateurish and simple craigslist is.  I know even this blog needs to be styled better.  But this is what I hope is a multi-year project that I just chip away at in my free time and things should look like a more put together package as I get more time.</h3><h3> The app is fully functional as noted before and I was going to start giving it away today to a select few comedians but in waiting for the ball to drop last night I downloaded the latest version on my phone and and I want to work that out.  I plan on heading back to Miami towards the end of the month and will be more active in distributing the beta release by then.  I'll also be networking quite a bit in the #MiamiTech scene because I'm going to have to pivot my attention a little bit away from programming to the actual rolling out of the project and all the issues involved with that.  I don't come from the tech world so I feel like I'm in my freshman year of college on this stuff.  So far I've just been watching Silicon Valley on HBO Max!\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Currently Working On</b>:  <ul><li>App: page doesn't refresh after transitioning to a separate page</li><li>Website: Making a new hamburger menu for website that uses React and grid</li><li>Website: create a real blog page that draws from a database</li> </ul>\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t<b>12/26/21</b> - The app is fully functional.

When you go and check into a show, you can \"favorite\" your top two comics that night.  You can follow your friends and see who they've seen and voted for lately.  When you travel to a different city you'll be able to help determine that city's top comic and help them get onto the global leaderboard.  Fans can follow comedians and be notified immediately when a new mic or showcase is announced by that comedian.  You can also list what comedian you want to see come to your city.  In the future, if there are a lot of people that want to see a comedian, we can let that comedian know! <br/><br/> \n\nWhen comedians interact with the app, they are getting their name out there to the most hardcore stand up comedy fans.  They may even get a tip from the audience because the app encourages it and also displays comedians' cash app/venmo .  Comedians can follow other comedians and be notified right away if a new mic is announced.\n\t\t\t    \n\t\t  </details>\t  \n\t\t\t  <br />\n\t\t  <details>\n\t\t      <summary>How do End Of Year Awards work?</summary>\n\t\t\t  The End Of Year Awards are won through competition.  We want comedians to use the competition as a credit generating machine to help further their careers. <br /><br /> \n\n\t\t\t  These are the awards you can win:  World's Top Comic, Top Comic (local), Hardest Working Comic, World's Top Mic/Host, Top Mic/Host (local), and Top Stand Up Comedy Scene.  The (currently) unofficial rules are <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oBSySD4xu3tu0gkZugnUw5hCP_2LxrSbNPkocMPDuis/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>, but basically checking into mics/showcases, submitting mics/showcases, and being funny and favorited by audience members will all help comedians and fans win prizes.  Comics can win cash prizes and credits while Fans can win tickets!  World's Top Comic will win $500 and Top Fan will win a pair of tickets to a show of their choosing!  See official rules for scoring rubric and prizes.  \n\t\t  </details>\t  \n\t\t    <br />\n\t\t  <details>\n\t\t      <summary>What is the ideal use case for the app?</summary>\n\t\t\t  I was talking to someone who said that she travels all over the place and loves stand up comedy but has no idea where to go other than the big shows.  Let's say she has a work trip in Denver.  She does all of her meetings and she has a flight the next day and doesn't know what to do the night before.  She can open the app and discover the local stand up scene.  She can see who is getting favorited from the community and see where they are performing.  Maybe she’ll see someone who will become a big star one day.  Maybe not.  Either way it’ll be in her profile and she will have supported the art form. <br/><br/>\n\nFor comedians, ideally there are people like the woman above in the audience, when under normal circumstances, she wouldn't have been there.  We are trying to give people that extra push to go see live stand up comedy and in turn get people in seats.  We are not trying to take market share, we are trying to make the market bigger.  Our success = your success. \n\t\t\t    \n\t\t  </details>\t  \n\t\t\t  <br/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t  <details>\n\t\t      <summary>What's with the open mic list?</summary>\n\t\t\t When I was traveling a lot I sometimes had a hard time finding open mics to perform at.

You can build up your history in the app.  I always thought it would be cool if the app were available years ago and you’d be able to look in your app and say “I saw Dave Chappelle at some divey open mic in Brooklyn and he wasn’t even that good yet!  I favorited some other comedian.”  You may see going to open mics/showcases as “collecting comedians” in your profile.   \n\t\t  </details>\n\n\t\t\t  <br />\n\t\t  \t\t  \t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>Why would I list myself as a host?</summary>\n\t\t\t When you are a host of a mic, you will receive an extra point for checking into the mic you are hosting.  You will also be eligible to win Top Mic/Host awards.  The app provides host features where you can see in real-time who has checked in.  Some people have mentioned that they can work with the bar to give drinks to the first people who check in.  Others have mentioned that they want to use it as the open mic sign up list.  If you are a host and want something in there, just send me a message.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   </details>\n\n\t\t\t  <br />\n\t\t\t  <details>  \n\t\t      <summary>Still having a hard time understanding what the app does?</summary>\n\t\t\tImagine it as the Untappd app, but for stand up comedy.  People use the Untappd app to discover new beers and show off what beers they are trying.  People will use Pobblebonk to discover new comedians and show off what comedians they've seen and who they liked the most.      \n\t\t  </details>\t<br />  <details>\n\t\t      <summary>What's the best way to get points as a comedian?</summary>\n\t\t\t Tell the audience to download the app and check in.  You can even put it on the flyer.  We will provide a QR code.  You can create a referral code to give to people.  Points given by fans are heavily weighted in the calculation of points.  If you get five fans to verify one performance, that’s 15 points!  With potential for more if they favorite you!     \n\t\t  </details> <br />\n <details>\n\t\t      <summary>Can I get validated at an open mic that only has comedians?</summary>\n\t\t\t    Yes, you can get validated by other comedians, you just won't receive the same amount of points per validation as you would from fans.\n </details><br />\n <details>\n\t\t      <summary>Well couldn't someone just get their friends to follow them all over the place to get points?</summary>\n\t\t\tYes, but in addition, the variety of people that validate you will figure into your score as well.  Over a contest that spans a whole year, winning by just bringing your friends around would be really hard and you might lose friends.   \n\t\t  </details>\n\t\t\t  <br/>\n\t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>Can't someone like Jo Koy tell one of their stadium audiences to download the app and favorite them and win the contest?</summary>\n\t\t\t    No, there is a requirement that in order to be eligible the user has to check into at least 4 open mics and be validated at one.\t  Winner must also have less than 1.25M followers on Instagram.  We’re not trying to find Dave Chappelle or Jo Koy, the world has already found them.  \n\t\t  </details>\n\t\t\t  <br/>\n\n\t\t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>How will you monetize?</summary>\n\t\t\t We're not sure yet, but the first thing we're going to try is find a sponsor if we get enough people using the app.  Ideally there is no cost to comedians, ever.  The Miami Open just happened here in Miami and they have banks, watch makers, and other sponsors.  Why wouldn't a media brand want to sponsor the only global competition for the next hot comic that is largely determined by the fans?  Or an upcoming comedy movie that wants to get the word out to comedy fans?  We need to grow in numbers, but If you are interested in sponsoring or know someone or some company who might…let’s talk and come up with something that makes sense. \n\t\t  </details>\n\t\t\t  <br />\n\n\t\t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>How long will this last?</summary>\n\t\t\tOne of the reasons I committed myself to this app is because I thought I could pull off teaching myself to code and therefore save the company tens to even hundreds of thousands of dollars in cost compared to hiring a developer.  Turns out that with some hard work and time I was able to pull that off somehow.  This brings our cost structure down and the biggest recurring expense on this venture right now is cash and non cash prizes that go straight to comedians.  I hope to continue in that spirit.  If we are unable to achieve the numbers this year to get a sponsor, there are ways to reduce costs until we pivot as we find the right product market fit.  We can even downsize prizes.  In other words, this can go on for a very long time even if we are unsuccessful in achieving a sponsor. I do view it as a legacy project that will run even after I'm gone.  If we get sponsors then EVERYTHING gets better.  We can make better prizes and try new things.  Festival in the top stand up scene each year, anyone?    \n\t\t  </details>\n\t\t\t  <br />\n\n\n\t\t\t  \t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>What's with the photoshoot for World's Top Comic?</summary>\n\t\t\t I am a photographer and the photo will be put on our website.  I see it as a fun trip for me but also by spending time with the Top Comic it’s a way to keep in touch with the comedy scene that the app serves.\n\t\t  </details>\n\n\t\t\t  <br />\n\t\t\t  \t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>How long has the app been available?</summary>\n\t\t\t It’s been around since August of 2022.  In that short time frame of 2022 alone we had 300+ check-ins and created what we believe is the biggest and most accurate open mic list in the world.  Winners of last year’s contest already received cash prizes and we are still working on merch for them!  Prizes have more than doubled for 2023! \n\t\t  </details>\n\t\t\t  <br />\n\t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>Why are you coming out with this FAQ now?</summary>\n\t\t\t We are in version 2 of the app.  This means that the contest portion of the app basically runs itself how it’s supposed to now.  This is a big relief and will allow us to now pivot to working on the fan experience and also reaching out to them and seeing what they like.   \n\t\t  </details>\n\n\t\t\t  <br />\n\n\n\t\t  \t\t  \t\t   <details>\n\t\t      <summary>What's coming in the future?</summary>\n\t\t\tA lot depends on how quickly things progress, but a lot of cool things we can do like booking options, badges, improved recommendation algorithms, and definitely merch! \n\t\t  </details>\n\n\t\t\t  <br />\n\n\t\t\t  <p>Thank you everyone for following along and reading this, please provide feedback if you have it.

The app has gone through a lot of revisions – I’ve submitted over 200 builds to the app stores since this all started less than a year ago!  I think it’s important to look at the value proposition from the standpoint of comedians, fans, sponsors, and investors. `}\n\n\t\t\t  </pre>\n\n\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"centertext\">Comedians</div>\n\n  <pre>\n\n\t  {`\nI want comedians to use this app to both make money and gain exposure.  There are plenty of ways to gain exposure, so I want to highlight that making some money on the app is front and center.  The monetization strategy of this app is through sponsorship.  That means the more we use this app, the bigger the sponsorship deals I can get and the more that can flow down to comedians’ hands.  This can be done on the global level, but also on the local level.  So for instance, if we get a decent amount of users in Austin, I can approach companies based in Austin to sponsor some prize money.  \n\nWhat is the cost to you?  Absolutely nothing!  You don’t have to pay to be considered, like at a comedy festival.  You just have to do what you were going to do anyway and just click a button to check in and watch your points go up.\n\n`}\n\n  </pre>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"centertext\">Fans</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  <pre>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  {`\n\nI’ve built the app so fans have a new way to experience live stand up comedy.  It’s one in which you get to choose your favorite comedians and doing so gives them points.  In fact the way that comedians can get the most points is through fan interaction.  So whether you thought a comedian was hilarious or even if you just want to support your scene, you can make that happen.  It’s also set up so if the comedian bombs, no one knows on the app.  But if they kill, they get rewarded.  It encourages you to go see your local scene because that's where the next global star is made.  Imagine seeing the next Dave Chappelle at an open mic or showcase and being able to show that you saw them there in the app!  Or, if you like you can go see the actual Dave Chappelle and have that be recorded too.  The app makes it so that you can open up the app wherever you are in the world and find great comedy around you and get suggestions.  To top it all off, you can get prizes at the end of the year just like the comedians!  It is a social app so you can share with your friends who you liked and brag about who saw who first.  In the future, there is a lot of opportunity here for you to build up your profile to come up with better recommendation algorithms based on your sense of humor.  And of course, a lot of opportunity for more prizes!\n\n`}\n\n\t\t\t\t  </pre>\n\n\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"centertext\">Sponsors</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t  <pre>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  {`\n\nWhen a company sponsors a competition, whether it be on the global or the local level they are getting seen by a demographic that loves to laugh and is willing to go out and spend money while doing so. \n\n\nAnd lastly...\n\n\n`}\n\t\t\t\t  </pre>\n\n\t\t\t\t  <div class=\"centertext\">Investors</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  <pre>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  {`\n\nCurrently, there are no investors so we don’t have to do anything to please them!  This is critical to the app.  I taught myself to code up this app and I continue to fund it myself.  I don’t have to be forced by an investor to monetize in some weird way.  I don’t have to create any profit at all for an investor.  To go even further, I don’t have a venue to pay or programmers to pay.  True I do want to pay myself, but I am gainfully employed and can run this at a loss for a while and having it replace my current job isn’t even necessary so running it at a small profit can be done for an even longer while if that is what is necessary to make this successful.  This means that more sponsorship money can drop down to comedians (and secondarily, fans).  Due to this unique setup I would put this company’s income statement against ANY comedy company in the world to see who gives the highest percentage of revenues to comedians.  This is a big point I want to get across.  \n\nIt is possible that costs may get out of control, in which case I may reach out to a VC, but I believe that won’t happen this year.  I already have existing relationships with people in the finance industry and will be keeping those lines of communication going in case they are needed.\n\nSo comedians and fans, we are in alignment here and I need you to use the app and keep giving me great feedback because that will bring sponsorship, comedian exposure, and ultimately make it fun for fans.  How big are the marketing budgets of big time comedy movies?  How big are the marketing budgets of alcohol companies?  The current prize pot we have is less than a drop in the bucket for them.  If we get one of those sponsorship deals, how much of that flows down to the comedian when I have no employees or investors to pay off?  The math adds up to a lot of money given away in a way that is completely new to the industry. \n\n\nA lot more to come...\n\n\nPete\n\nNext topic:  What are we going to do about the name?\n\n`}\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  </pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t  </body>\n\n\t  </html>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nexport default Boardroom;\n","//import {useState} from 'react';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport Home from './pages/Home'\nimport Blog from './pages/Blog'\nimport Contact from './pages/Contact'\nimport About from './pages/About'\nimport Legal from './pages/Legal'\nimport Tos from './pages/Tos'\nimport Pp from './pages/Pp'\nimport Promotion22 from './pages/Promotion22'\nimport Promotion23 from './pages/Promotion23'\nimport HOF from './pages/HOF'\nimport FAQ from './pages/FAQ'\nimport Boardroom from './pages/Boardroom'\n\nfunction App() {\n\n\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n\t  <Routes>\n\t\t  <Route path=\"/blog\" element={<Blog/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/\" element={<Home/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/Contact\" element={<Contact/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/About\" element={<About/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/Legal\" element={<Legal/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/Tos\" element={<Tos/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/Pp\" element={<Pp/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/Promotion22\" element={<Promotion22/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/HOF\" element={<HOF/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/FAQ\" element={<FAQ/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/Promotion23\" element={<Promotion23/>} />\n\t\t  <Route exact path = \"/Boardroom\" element={<Boardroom/>} />\n\t\t  \n\t</Routes>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n//import './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\nimport { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <BrowserRouter>\n    <App/>\n  </BrowserRouter>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
