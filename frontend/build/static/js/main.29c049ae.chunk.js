I'm still trying to figure out what I'll end up putting here.  I think I'm drawn to Shawn Wang's concept of \"Learning in Public.\"  Mostly because I've learned so much from other developers who have done the same.  In fact I'm still to this day shocked at how easy it is to find tutorials/blog posts/and real live help from people for free online.  I feel a bit indebted to the software dev community in that sense and would love to help anyone out who could somewhat benefit from me.  Learning in public is basically putting out in public what you're working on and learning even though you feel like you don't have a clue what you're doing.  In return you might be able to help someone out like how others have already helped you out, you'll track your progress, and you'll be more motivated to get things done.  Probably the most important is that you'll learn things better when you know you might have to teach it.  Plain and simple. To start off I want to say flat out that I know everything that you see here looks unpolished.  I don't know if that's a bad or a good thing.  I mean, I loved how amateurish and simple craigslist is.  I know even this blog needs to be styled better.

This brings our cost structure down and the biggest recurring expense on this venture right now is cash and non cash prizes that go straight to comedians.  I hope to continue in that spirit.  If we are unable to achieve the numbers this year to get a sponsor, there are ways to reduce costs until we pivot as we find the right product market fit.  We can even downsize prizes.  In other words, this can go on for a very long time even if we are unsuccessful in achieving a sponsor. I do view it as a legacy project that will run even after I'm gone.
