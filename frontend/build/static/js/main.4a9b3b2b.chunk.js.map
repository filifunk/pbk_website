It's an app made specifically for the local comedy community.  Secondly, please be patient as we are in our first year and trying to figure ourselves out.  I would describe us as a pilot program.  We don't know exactly how this will turn out.  Just look at how unattractive this page looks lol -- clearly we're working on ourselves.  Thirdly, an important cornerstone of this app is a points system.  For the most part users will get points by checking into mics.  What can you do with points?  We're still figuring this out but this is a rough framework:<ul>\n\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t    <br />\n\t\t\t    <li>The comedian with the most points every six months will get a free headshot/comedy cover photoshoot and will be posted on @pobblebonklive on IG.  We'll fly out to you.</li>\n\t\t\t    <li>The fan with the most points every six months will get a free ticket to a show in their area</li>\n\t\t\t    <li>Since we are based in Miami everything that we do will be first tried in Miami.  The Miami fan with the most points every three months in Miami will get a free ticket to a show in Miami</li>\n\n\t\t\t    <li>The first 100 of you who submit a verified mic that then has someone check into that is not you, you will be asked if you want access to the beta version of the Notes app and you can be a beta tester.  Eventually the Notes app will have at least two tiers of a premium version and all beta testers will get the first tier free.</li>\n\n\t\t\t    <li><b>Lastly, the biggest bonus of all: every three months for the next year at least, the comedian who submits the most mics will get an \"Everything\" account.  This means that everything that eventually comes to this app in the future will be free FOREVER. </b>  The mic that you submit does not have to be your own!  It just has to be verified with a flyer or a listing on another site.  I'm trying to avoid the situation where someone just submits their home address and just checks in each week to get their points up.</li>\n\t\t    </ul>\n\t\t\t<b>Currently Working on:</b>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Points system needs to be worked on.  It has to benefit people who go to a variety of mics.</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Getting it passable for iOS App Store, which we believe is more likely to deny the app.</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t<br />\n\n\t\n\n\t    \n\t\t\t<b> 1/1/22</b> - Happy New Year from Michigan!  I'm still trying to figure out what I'll end up putting here.  I think I'm drawn to Shawn Wang's concept of \"Learning in Public.\"  Mostly because I've learned so much from other developers who have done the same.  In fact I'm still to this day shocked at how easy it is to find tutorials/blog posts/and real live help from people for free online.  I feel a bit indebted to the software dev community in that sense and would love to help anyone out who could somewhat benefit from me.  Learning in public is basically putting out in public what you're working on and learning even though you feel like you don't have a clue what you're doing.  In return you might be able to help someone out like how others have already helped you out, you'll track your progress, and you'll be more motivated to get things done.  Probably the most important is that you'll learn things better when you know you might have to teach it.  Plain and simple.\n\t\t\tTo start off I want to say flat out that I know everything that you see here looks unpolished.  I don't know if that's a bad or a good thing.  I mean, I loved how amateurish and simple craigslist is.  I know even this blog needs to be styled better.  But this is what I hope is a multi-year project that I just chip away at in my free time and things should look like a more put together package as I get more time.</h3><h3> The app is fully functional as noted before and I was going to start giving it away today to a select few comedians but in waiting for the ball to drop last night I downloaded the latest version on my phone and and I want to work that out.  I plan on heading back to Miami towards the end of the month and will be more active in distributing the beta release by then.  I'll also be networking quite a bit in the #MiamiTech scene because I'm going to have to pivot my attention a little bit away from programming to the actual rolling out of the project and all the issues involved with that.  I don't come from the tech world so I feel like I'm in my freshman year of college on this stuff.  So far I've just been watching Silicon Valley on HBO Max!\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Currently Working On</b>:  <ul><li>App: page doesn't refresh after transitioning to a separate page</li><li>Website: Making a new hamburger menu for website that uses React and grid</li><li>Website: create a real blog page that draws from a database</li> </ul>\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t<b>12/26/21</b> - The app is fully functional.
