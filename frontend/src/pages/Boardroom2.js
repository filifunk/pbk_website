Comedy Cash is kicked out of the running for the app name, but I think it's important to get across that $ is central to the app.  Sure you can get bragging rights, but we think its cool that a comic gets a few hundred dollars right before end of year holidays.  It's not going to change anyones life but it's like a gift that comes with a title and you don't have to do anything different other than hitting the check-in button to participate.  And obviously if the app grows the prizes grow too.  That's the model.

I'm adding onto the global leaderboard a 4th prize of $200 and a 5th prize of $100.

I'm also adding $300 to the Brooklyn leaderboard.  Brooklyn has the most users and the most check-ins and it just has...potential.  It's largely because of @alexmakesjokes and @maxkaczor.  Even just looking at the open mic map, it's a legitimate resource in that city.  Brooklyn will be the city I try this on this year.  I'm unsure whether I should combine Brooklyn with all of NYC, this will be tbd.  I still don't know whether what we have in Brooklyn is enough to get a sponsor into it, but I think it could be fun to try.  Next year as we have more features and more users I would expect it will be much easier.    

This is the only city that I'm trying this on.  By the time December rolls around I will announce one other city for '24 if it picks up elsewhere.  By mid-year '24 I may announce more as higher levels of confidence are achieved.  The amount of cities is basically unlimited and it could be anywhere in the world (part of me thinks there's some interest in Australia) I just don't want to waste my time on a city that isn't engaging.  It is based on check-ins, the user base, and honestly whether I feel good about the leaders there and even interactions with some of the comics I talk to on instagram or in person.  It has to go where it seems welcome.  But it's mostly check-ins.  It may be that this hyperfocuses the app to Brooklyn for 2023, but it won't entirely.

Can this all end?  Yes, if it doesn't grow.  Then this just goes into the graveyard of apps and websites that have tried to make something work in stand up comedy (I can name 4 off the top of my head).  The titles and cash can all be stripped away and should under the right circumstances.  But no plan B's until 2025 at the earliest.  Too many ideas left, things to learn, and fun to be had trying to make this work. 

So check-in if you want it to stay!
