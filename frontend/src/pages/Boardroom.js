Now that I feel like the features available for fans and comedians are satisfactory, I thought I should drop the 2023 prizes and contextualize everything with my current thoughts.  The app has gone through a lot of revisions – I’ve submitted over 200 builds to the app stores since this all started less than a year ago!  I think it’s important to look at the value proposition from the standpoint of comedians, fans, sponsors, and investors. `}

				  <div class="centertext">Comedians</div>

  <pre>

	  {`
I want comedians to use this app to both make money and gain exposure.  There are plenty of ways to gain exposure, so I want to highlight that making some money on the app is front and center.  The monetization strategy of this app is through sponsorship.  That means the more we use this app, the bigger the sponsorship deals I can get and the more that can flow down to comedians’ hands.  This can be done on the global level, but also on the local level.  So for instance, if we get a decent amount of users in Austin, I can approach companies based in Austin to sponsor some prize money.  

What is the cost to you?  Absolutely nothing!  You don’t have to pay to be considered, like at a comedy festival.  You just have to do what you were going to do anyway and just click a button to check in and watch your points go up.

`}

				  <div class="centertext">Fans</div>


				  <pre>

					  {`

I’ve built the app so fans have a new way to experience live stand up comedy.  It’s one in which you get to choose your favorite comedians and doing so gives them points.  In fact the way that comedians can get the most points is through fan interaction.  So whether you thought a comedian was hilarious or even if you just want to support your scene, you can make that happen.  It’s also set up so if the comedian bombs, no one knows on the app.  But if they kill, they get rewarded.  It encourages you to go see your local scene because that's where the next global star is made.  Imagine seeing the next Dave Chappelle at an open mic or showcase and being able to show that you saw them there in the app!  Or, if you like you can go see the actual Dave Chappelle and have that be recorded too.  The app makes it so that you can open up the app wherever you are in the world and find great comedy around you and get suggestions.  To top it all off, you can get prizes at the end of the year just like the comedians!  It is a social app so you can share with your friends who you liked and brag about who saw who first.  In the future, there is a lot of opportunity here for you to build up your profile to come up with better recommendation algorithms based on your sense of humor.  And of course, a lot of opportunity for more prizes!

				  <div class="centertext">Sponsors</div>

				  <pre>

					  {`

When a company sponsors a competition, whether it be on the global or the local level they are getting seen by a demographic that loves to laugh and is willing to go out and spend money while doing so. 


And lastly...


`}
				  </pre>

				  <div class="centertext">Investors</div>


				  <pre>


					  {`

Currently, there are no investors so we don’t have to do anything to please them!  This is critical to the app.  I taught myself to code up this app and I continue to fund it myself.  I don’t have to be forced by an investor to monetize in some weird way.  I don’t have to create any profit at all for an investor.  To go even further, I don’t have a venue to pay or programmers to pay.  True I do want to pay myself, but I am gainfully employed and can run this at a loss for a while and having it replace my current job isn’t even necessary so running it at a small profit can be done for an even longer while if that is what is necessary to make this successful.  This means that more sponsorship money can drop down to comedians (and secondarily, fans).  Due to this unique setup I would put this company’s income statement against ANY comedy company in the world to see who gives the highest percentage of revenues to comedians.  This is a big point I want to get across.  

It is possible that costs may get out of control, in which case I may reach out to a VC, but I believe that won’t happen this year.  I already have existing relationships with people in the finance industry and will be keeping those lines of communication going in case they are needed.

So comedians and fans, we are in alignment here and I need you to use the app and keep giving me great feedback because that will bring sponsorship, comedian exposure, and ultimately make it fun for fans.  How big are the marketing budgets of big time comedy movies?  How big are the marketing budgets of alcohol companies?  The current prize pot we have is less than a drop in the bucket for them.  If we get one of those sponsorship deals, how much of that flows down to the comedian when I have no employees or investors to pay off?  The math adds up to a lot of money given away in a way in a modality that is completely new to the industry. 


A lot more to come...
