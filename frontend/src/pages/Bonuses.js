		    <h3> First off, we're very excited to be launching the Pobblebonk app!  It's an app made specifically for the local comedy community.  Secondly, please be patient as we are in our first year and trying to figure ourselves out.  I would describe us as a pilot program.  I don't know exactly how this will turn out.  Just look at how unattractive this page looks lol -- clearly we're working on ourselves.  Thirdly, an important cornerstone of this app is a points system.  For the most part users will get points by checking into mics.  What can you do with points?  We're still figuring this out but this is a rough framework:<ul>
			    
			    <br />
			    <li>The comedian with the most points every six months will get a free headshot/comedy cover photoshoot and will be posted on @pobblebonklive on IG.  We'll fly out to you.</li>
			    <li>The fan with the most points every six months will get a free ticket to a show in their area</li>
			    <li>Since we are based in Miami everything that we do will be first tried in Miami.  The Miami fan with the most points every three months in Miami will get a free ticket to a show in Miami</li>

			    <li>The first 100 of you who submit a verified mic that then has someone check into that is not you, you will be asked if you want access to the beta version of the Notes app and you can be a beta tester.  Eventually the Notes app will have at least two tiers of a premium version and all beta testers will get the first tier free.</li>

			    <li><b>Lastly, the biggest bonus of all: every three months for the next year at least, the comedian who submits the most mics will get an "Everything" account.  This means that everything that eventually comes to this app in the future will be free FOREVER. </b>  The mic that you submit does not have to be your own!  It just has to be verified with a flyer or a listing on another site.  I'm trying to avoid the situation where someone just submits their home address and just checks in each week to get their points up.</li>
		    </ul>
