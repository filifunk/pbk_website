		    <p><h2>Before COVID hit I was experimenting with stand up comedy just as something to do.  When COVID hit, I spent a lot of my free time learning how to code.  I was experimenting mostly with Python and how I could use that with 3D printing. I came up with some cool ideas, but all of that stopped when I had the idea for Pobblebonk late in 2020.  It wasn't until early 2021 that it hit me that it needed to evolve into a mobile app.  I've been working on that mobile app ever since.</h2></p>  

		    <p><h2>Pobblebonk is a long term side project. I only work on it during my free time as dictated by my actual job and other activities.  This project may be something that could end in 2022 for good or it could potentially be something I just keep working on for a decade or more depending on peoples' interest.  Ultimately, the overarching question for Pobblebonk will always be:</h2></p>
		    <p><h2><b> Does it improve stand up and the lives of stand up comedians? </b></h2></p>  <p><h2>If not, then we either have to change or quit.
		</h2></p>

			    <p><h2>More to come so visit the blog!  Just know that I'm trying to take stand up comedy into the future!</h2></p>
